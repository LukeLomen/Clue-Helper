# Clue-Helper

Want to ruin game night by bringing out your screen and winning every time? Boy do I have the app for you!

This app was designed to keep track of all the suggestions made and infer what the other players are holding.
The methods used could be done on paper but it would take a lot of room and a detailed organization.
